        <p className="mt-4 text-slate-700">In regulated industries, accuracy, compliance, and trust aren't negotiable — they determine whether your organization can deploy AI at scale without exposure. General-purpose platforms introduce risk at every layer: data leakage, unverifiable outputs, and compliance gaps that can't be closed after the fact.</p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-slate-700">XFinLabs delivers full-spectrum control: encrypted environments, auditable workflows, and zero-hallucination architecture. This isn't incremental improvement — it's a structural shift that redefines what enterprise AI can deliver when precision, governance, and ownership are built in from the start.</p>
